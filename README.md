# Autenticacao.gov.pt Bruteforcer POF

A simple Proof-Of-Concept of the [autenticacao.gov.pt](https://autenticacao.gov.pt/)
*Chave MÃ³vel Digital* (CMD) system that allows you to bruteforce PINs and find out
wether a mobile number is associated with an account or not.

# Note

This is draft code. It's has not been cleaned-up. It was written "just to work", in order
to show the exploit programatically. I'm realeasing it as supporting material for my
blog post.
